The objective of this project is to build a data pipeline that builds a connection graph between drugs and their mentions in scientific articles.

# Next steps

* Implement all the tests (in a `tests` folder for example)
* Add the docstrings for all the functions
* Add a documentation with Sphinx for example
* Implement a CI/CD pipeline
